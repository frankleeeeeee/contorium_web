# Persistent Memory Layer for AI Coding

Contorium gives AI a continuous understanding of your workspace, goals, Git changes, and coding sessions.

Instead of losing context every chat, model switch, IDE restart, or session recovery,  
Contorium continuously maintains a structured workspace memory for AI.

Built for developers who work with AI every day.

## Repository layout (Cursor Marketplace + VS Code extension)

This repo follows the [Cursor plugin template](https://github.com/cursor/plugin-template) **single-plugin-at-root** layout, with the existing VS Code extension host unchanged:

```

- **Cursor Marketplace**: submit this Git repository ([publish guide](https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish)). Run `npm run validate:plugin` before submission.
- **VS Code / Cursor IDE extension**: build with `npm run vsix` and install the `.vsix` for the sidebar, scanners, and clipboard export.
- **Claude Code / MCP**: build with `npm run build:mcp`, then see [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) for `claude mcp add` and Cursor `mcp.json` setup.

Internal command and config IDs remain `contora.*`; display name is **Contorium**.

# Why Contorium?

Most AI coding tools forget everything.

You switch:
- chats
- models
- sessions
- machines
- IDE windows

…and your AI assistant loses track of:
- what you were building
- which files mattered
- recent Git changes
- project intent
- active debugging context

Contorium fixes that.

It continuously tracks your active workspace and turns it into a persistent AI memory layer.

So your AI can continue where you left off.

---

# What Makes Contorium Different?

Contorium is not another AI chat panel.

It is a:

# Workspace-aware AI Memory System

Contorium continuously maintains:
- current focus
- active files
- recent edits
- Git changes
- workspace intent
- event history
- session summaries
- compressed context memory

All stored locally inside your workspace.

---

# Designed for Real AI Coding Workflows

## Resume AI coding sessions

Close Cursor today.

Open it tomorrow.

Your AI still understands:
- what you were working on
- which files mattered
- what changed
- your coding goal
- recent project activity

---

## Keep AI aware across large codebases

Contorium continuously tracks:
- working-set files
- recent activity
- Git changes
- active editors
- project focus

Perfect for:
- monorepos
- long refactors
- debugging sessions
- AI agent workflows
- large enterprise projects

---

## Switch models without rebuilding context

Move between:
- GPT
- Claude
- Gemini
- DeepSeek

without rebuilding workspace memory every time.

---

## Reduce AI token usage

Large projects can quickly explode token costs.

Contorium reduces unnecessary AI context by:
- tracking only active workspace changes
- prioritizing important files
- compressing recent activity
- filtering noisy paths
- generating compact structured memory

Instead of sending your entire repository every session,
Contorium helps AI focus on what actually matters.

Especially useful for:
- long AI coding sessions
- monorepos
- expensive frontier models
- agent loops
- high-frequency AI workflows

Designed to reduce:
- token usage
- repeated context rebuilding
- unnecessary AI calls
- AI cost overhead

---

# Core Features

## AI Workspace Memory

Persistent workspace state:
- current task
- notes
- active files
- recent activity
- Git changes
- workspace intent
- session memory

Stored locally inside:

```text
.contora/
```

---

## Current Focus Tracking

Set your current focus manually.

Contorium continuously updates surrounding workspace context automatically.

Example:

```text
Current Focus:
Refactor payment retry system

AI inferred goals:
- improve retry stability
- optimize error classification
- reduce duplicate requests
```

---

## Git-aware Context

Contorium automatically tracks:
- staged files
- modified files
- working-tree changes

and prioritizes them in AI context generation.

---

## Context Compression

Large codebases generate noisy AI context.

Contorium compresses workspace activity into:
- semantic summaries
- ranked priority files
- compact event history
- structured memory blocks

Designed for long-running AI workflows.

---

## Workspace Intent Analysis

Analyze project direction using optional BYOK AI providers.

Generate:
- inferred goals
- workspace intent
- feature direction
- task grouping

Results are stored locally and reused across sessions.

---

## Session Recovery

Save and restore:
- open editors
- workspace state
- active memory
- project context

Your AI coding session becomes persistent.

---

## Local-first Architecture

Contorium is designed to work locally first.

- No cloud sync
- No chat log scraping
- No hidden telemetry
- Workspace-owned memory

Your workspace memory stays under your control.

---

## Optional BYOK AI Features

Bring your own API keys:
- OpenAI
- Claude
- Gemini
- DeepSeek

Used only when running optional AI commands.

API keys are stored securely in:
- VS Code SecretStorage

Never inside:
- settings.json
